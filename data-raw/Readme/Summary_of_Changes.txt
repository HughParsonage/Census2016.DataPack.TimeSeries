# August Re-issue of TSP with amendments to 2006 geography

Note: This updated 2016 Time Series Profile uses an approximate population based geographic allocation of 2006 Collector Districts to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard output areas. This is consistent with the approach used for the 2011 Time Series Profile. A previous release of the 2016 Time Series Profile used an approximate area based allocation. Both approaches are statistically valid but result in marginally different population counts.
